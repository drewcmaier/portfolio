				I'm currently a Software Engineer at <a href="https://employers.indeed.com">Indeed</a>,
				where I work on the Employer product.
			</p>
			<img src={employer} class="project-img" alt="Indeed for Employers page" />
			<p>
				I collaborate closely with product owners to realize designs created by UX designers.
				Another aspect of my role is establishing best practices for usability, accessibility, and
				consistency.
			</p>
			<p>
				This role represented a significant career pivot for me, transitioning from the game
				industry to web development. After over a decade making games, I became interested in
				applying my frontend expertise in other contexts. I also wanted expand my breadth of
				knowledge by learning web technologies. While Indeed may not seem to have much in common
				with video games, I apply my background from game UI on a daily basis.

				As a Senior UI Engineer, I was responsible for architecting and implementing in-game UI for <a
					href="http://fractured-lands.com/">Fractured Lands</a
				>. This included the inventory menu, game map, and multiplayer party management screen.

				I developed 2 AAA games at Gearbox as a UI Programmer: <a
					href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-3/">Borderlands 3</a
				>
				and <a href="https://2k.com/en-US/game/battleborn-standard-edition/">Battleborn</a>. In both
				of these games, I implemented UI systems for the heads-up display (HUD), item menus, and map
				screens.
			</p>
			<img src={bl3} class="project-img" alt="Screenshot from Borderlands 3" />
			<p>
				Borderlands 3 was especially challenging to work on because it was Gearbox's first game
				developed with Unreal Engine 4.

				Returning to Electronic Arts, I was a Software Engineer for EA Mobile and worked primarily
				on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Keeper_(2014_video_game)"
					>Dungeon Keeper</a
				>, the studio's final game, which released for iOS and Android.
			</p>
			<img src={dk} class="project-img" alt="Screenshot from Dungeon Keeper" />
			<p>
				While my stint at EA Mobile was short, I learned a lot about game development and working on
				a large team.

			<p>
				I was a Lead Engineer for Zabu, a startup that created licensed online adaptations of board
				games.
			</p>
			<img src={ts} class="project-img-small" alt="Screenshot from Thunderstone" />
			<p>
				Because this was a small company, I wore many hats: gameplay programmer, backend programmer,
				and occasional designer.

				My first tech job was as a Gameplay Engineer for <a href="https://www.pogo.com">pogo.com</a
				>, a subsidiary of Electronic Arts.
			</p>
			<img src={puck} class="project-img-small" alt="Screenshot from Puck's Peak" />
			<p>
				At Pogo, my most important contribution was migrating games from Java applets to Flash,
				where I became a subject matter expert and established best practices for future games.
